# Development of a Web Application to enhance Aiport Security
This is a project Developing a Website Application for Deploying of a Deep Learning Project. A project that was in my 
3rd year of FYP Poly year. The deployment through heroku did not succeed, however the development of a website 
application that uses AI algorithm to detect and count objects/people is successful.

##Project Overview
Development and Implementation of advanced Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence technologies. To perform object 
recognition and tracking on a web application framework. This project aims to count people and identify unattended 
suitcases to enhance airport security. 

##Goals & Objective
The program is designed to perform real-time object detection and region counting on a Live web feed using the YOLOv8 
model. This project could upscale solution capabilities of handling a wide range of objects and diverse scenarios. 
The development of a user-friendly web interface through Flask ensures that users, even with minimal technical 
expertise, can harness the power of real-time object detection.
